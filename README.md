# Uncovering Stress Fields and Defect Distributions in Graphene Using Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains several MATLAB scripts used to generate LAMMPS data/input files as well as postprocessing the numerical results of the simulations (i.e., to transformed into image-based data) in our recent article in the [International Journal of Fracture (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10704-023-00704-z). A video abstract of the article is [available here](https://youtu.be/cUXWU6oaud4).

Contains trained cGANs, data, and MATLAB scripts used in our recent paper

This repository contains the MD (LAMMPS) models and the DFT (VASP) model (shown below), which we used the article Journal of Applied Physics 131, 025102 (2022). A video abstract of the article is available here.
